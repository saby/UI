<!-- Key generating during SSR and on client will be different
   because of using the Controls/Application/Route.wml during the SSR
   Starting from this point key generation during SSR and on client won't be different
   so we need to set attr:key, to fix difference between keys on client and keys on server -->
<ws:partial template="{{application}}" attr:key="bd_" scope="{{_options}}"
            on:themeChanged="setTheme()"
            on:changeApplication="changeApplicationHandler()"/>
